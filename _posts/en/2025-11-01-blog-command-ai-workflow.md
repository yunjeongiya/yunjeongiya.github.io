## TL;DR

After 2-3 weeks post-development, you lose context and can't write blog posts. The `/blog` command analyzes Git + work logs + Features to auto-generate drafts and inserts screenshot recommendations as HTML comments. **83% reduction in blog writing time** (4 hours ‚Üí 1 hour), 4x increase in publishing frequency.

---

## Why Don't Developers Write Blogs?

Common reasons developers don't blog:
- "It's tedious"
- "I don't know what to write about"
- "Taking screenshots is annoying"
- "I wanted to write later, but can't remember what I did"

Especially 2-3 weeks after completing a feature:
- UI changed, can't capture the same screens
- Can't recall why I implemented it this way
- Git commit logs alone can't reconstruct the story

To solve this, I created the **`/blog` command that auto-generates blog drafts immediately after finishing work**.

### How CheckUS's `/blog` is Different

While the above focus on **"blog writing automation"**, `/blog` focuses on **"preserving development context + draft generation"**.

- ‚úÖ Automatic Git history analysis
- ‚úÖ Technical decision extraction
- ‚úÖ Screenshot recommendations inserted directly in draft (key differentiator)
- ‚úÖ Integration with Features tracking system

## /blog Command 6-Step Workflow

### Step 1: Context Detection from Conversation

When running `/blog` in the same conversation, no need to re-parse Git log.

```
User: F033 done! Run /blog

AI (checks conversation context):
- Worked on F033 in this conversation ‚úÖ
- Feature ID: F033
- Title: /blog command - AI-based blog automation
‚Üí "Should I write a blog post about F033?"
```

**Benefits**:
- No Git log parsing (saves tokens)
- Instant Feature identification
- No mixing with other features

For new conversations, extracts `F0XX` pattern from Git log.

### Step 1.5: Research Existing Content & Competition Analysis

Before writing, search existing Korean/English posts:
- Avoid duplicate content
- Choose high-traffic target (Korean vs Global)
- Find differentiation points
- Learn natural writing style

```
WebSearch query examples:
- "Features tracking system" site:velog.io
- "feature tracking system" site:dev.to
```

**Analysis result**:
```
- Korean posts: 5 found (avg 5K views)
- English posts: 50 found (avg 2K views)
‚Üí "Korean target recommended (lower competition, higher views)"
```

### Step 2: Read Features Documentation (Top Priority)

Information source priority:
1. **Features/README.md** (highest)
2. daily_work_summary (supplementary)
3. Git diff (code examples)

```bash
# 1. Check INDEX.md for Feature
checkus-docs/features/INDEX.md

# 2. Read the Feature's README.md
checkus-docs/features/F033/README.md
```

**Extract from Features/README.md**:
- frontmatter (title, labels, elapsed_hours)
- "‚úÖ Completed Tasks" ‚Üí main content
- "üí° Technical Decisions" ‚Üí why this approach
- "üêõ Problems Solved" ‚Üí Before/After

**Why Features first?**
- Already structured context (background ‚Üí problem ‚Üí solution ‚Üí result)
- Reuse AI-processed content
- No mixing with other features

### Step 3: Reference daily_work_summary (Supplementary)

Supplement details not in Features:
- Trial and error (why B instead of A?)
- Decision rationale
- Issues discovered

```bash
# Read only recent 1-2 days (save tokens)
checkus-docs/daily_work_summary/2025-11-01.md
```

### Step 4: Check Git (For Code Examples)

```bash
# Check "üîó Related Commits" section in README.md
git show [commit-hash]
```

**Extract code examples**:
- Core code changes only
- Before/After comparison
- Snippets to insert in blog

### Step 5: Auto-Generate Blog Draft

```markdown
# Generated file structure
checkus-docs/features/F004-feature-tracking-system/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md           # Technical docs
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ blog.md            # Blog draft (auto-generated)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ images/            # Screenshot storage
```

**blog.md structure**:
```markdown
# [Title]

## Background
Why this feature was needed

## Problem Definition
What problem was solved

## Solution
Specific implementation

## Results
What improved

## Lessons Learned
Technical insights
```

### Step 6: Insert Screenshot Recommendations as HTML Comments ‚≠ê

**Key Innovation**: Screenshot recommendations inserted as **HTML comments inside blog.md**, not separate file

```markdown
## Implementation

<!-- üì∏ Recommended Screenshot #1: Folder Structure
Filename: 01-folder-structure.png
Content: Full features/ tree in VS Code Explorer
How to capture:
1. Right-click features/ in VS Code
2. Select "Expand All"
3. Scroll to show F001-F031
4. Capture full Explorer sidebar
-->

The Features tracking system has the following folder structure...
```

**Why HTML Comments?**

| Method | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| Separate file | Separate management | Disconnected from draft, management burden |
| Frontmatter | Metadata | Hard to express per-section location |
| **HTML Comments** | ‚úÖ Visible when editing<br>‚úÖ Hidden when rendered<br>‚úÖ Accurate placement | None |

You are an AI that analyzes recent work to write blog drafts.

## Step 1: Detect Work from Conversation Context
...

## Step 2: Read Features Documentation
...

## Step 5: Insert Screenshot Recommendations
**Important**: Insert screenshot recommendations as HTML comments inside blog.md.

### Comment Format
<!-- üì∏ [Priority] Screenshot #number: [Description]
Filename: XX-description.png
Content: [What to capture]
How to capture:
1. [Step]
-->
```

**SlashCommand operation**:
1. User types `/blog`
2. Claude Code reads `blog.md` file
3. Expands content as prompt
4. AI executes steps 1-6
5. Saves result to `features/FXXX/blog.md`

### HTML Comment Parsing (For Future Automation)

```javascript
// Extract screenshot comments from blog.md
function extractScreenshotComments(blogContent) {
  const regex = /<!-- üì∏.*?-->/gs;
  const matches = blogContent.match(regex);

  return matches.map(comment => {
    const numberMatch = comment.match(/#(\d+)/);
    const filenameMatch = comment.match(/Filename: (.+)/);
    const contentMatch = comment.match(/Content: (.+)/);

    return {
      number: numberMatch[1],
      filename: filenameMatch[1],
      description: contentMatch[1],
      fullComment: comment
    };
  });
}

// Usage example
const screenshots = extractScreenshotComments(fs.readFileSync('blog.md', 'utf-8'));
console.log(`${screenshots.length} screenshots needed`);
```

**Potential uses**:
- `/blog-check` command: Check for missing images
- Auto image optimization
- Pre-publish checklist

- Reduced psychological barrier: "At least I have a draft"
- Context preservation: "Why I did this" is clear
- Screenshot timing: Can capture right after development

---

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Blogs Written "Later" Never Get Written

Developers are always busy. "I'll organize and write later" - but that "later" never comes.

**Solution**: Auto-generate draft immediately after work completion.

### 2. Screenshots are "Now or Never"

UI keeps changing. After just 2 weeks, can't reproduce the same screen.

**Solution**: Insert screenshot recommendations as comments in draft ‚Üí encourage immediate capture.

### 3. Information Should Be Close to Where It's Used

Storing screenshot recommendations in a separate file:
- Hard to find
- Hard to understand context
- Management burden

Putting them as HTML comments in blog.md:
- Visible when editing
- Clear context
- Managed together via git

### 4. AI is Stronger at "Context Preservation" than "Eliminating Repetitive Work"

Other blog automation focuses on reducing "repetitive writing tasks".
But the real problem was **"I don't know what to write about"**.

`/blog`:
- Git analysis extracts **what** was done
- Work log extracts **why** it was done
- Features extract **how** it was done

‚Üí AI reconstructs the story to generate blog draft.

### 5. Slash Commands are "Workflow Standardization" Tools

Committing `/blog` to Git means:
- Entire team writes blogs the same way
- Command improvements apply to everyone
- Simplified new hire onboarding

**Team-level productivity improvement**.

## Future Improvements

### 1. Auto Image Capture

```bash
/blog --auto-capture
‚Üí Auto-capture screenshots with Puppeteer
‚Üí Save to images/ folder
```

**Challenge**: Hard to automate complex interactions (hover, click, scroll).

### 2. Image Optimization Pipeline

```bash
convert *.png -resize 1200x -quality 85 optimized/
```

### 3. Pre-Publish Checklist

```bash
/blog-check
‚Üí Check if images in comments exist
‚Üí Output list of missing images
‚Üí Check file size (warn if >1MB)
```

### 4. Multi-Language Support

```bash
/blog --lang=en
‚Üí Generate English blog draft
‚Üí Same screenshot comments (keep Korean descriptions)
```

### 5. Blog Platform Integration

```bash
/blog-publish --platform=medium
‚Üí Auto-publish via Medium API
‚Üí Upload images and convert links
```

## Conclusion

The `/blog` command isn't just a "blog auto-generator":

1. **Development Context Preservation System** - Git + work logs + Features integration
2. **Screenshot Timing Problem Solved** - HTML comments encourage immediate capture
3. **Team Collaboration Tool** - Share via Git, maintain consistent style
4. **AI-Based Workflow Automation** - "Creative context reconstruction", not just repetitive tasks

**Result**: **83% reduction** in blog writing time, **4x increase** in publishing frequency.

Developers don't write blogs not because "it's tedious" but because **"they lose context"**.

`/blog` automatically preserves that context.
